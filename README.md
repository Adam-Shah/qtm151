# QTM 151 - Introduction to Statistical Computing II

This is the QTM 151 GitHub repository. I organized the folders in the following way:

1. Slides: R Markdown and PDFs.
2. Data: Datasets used for this class (feel free to suggest other datasets!)
3. RScripts: scripts that we write during class.

#Emory! Cor prudentis possidebit scientiam.
